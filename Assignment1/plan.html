<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan</h1>
<h1>Diggers Beach Volleyball</h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong>Ji Hyun Park<br>
<strong>Login:</strong> jc314278</p>
<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>The Diggers Beach Volleyball website is intended to make business more successful and to increase number of people playing beach volleyball, especially the teenagers and young adults for them to enjoy playing and socialise with other people.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>Different types of advertising will be constant for 2 month (excluding website) so that the client can check website's attribution to increase in number of players. After every 2 months, number of new players will be count and compared with previous 2 months. Also, the bounce rate (rate of people who left website without clicking further links) can be counted to check how many people are actually interested in the website.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Diggers Beach Volleyball wants to get player of all ages, but currently, most of the players are 35-50. So, Target Audience will be younger audinece who will be high school kids and young adults, who the site is aimed at. I will design the website with unique font and pictures to attract younger people.</p>
